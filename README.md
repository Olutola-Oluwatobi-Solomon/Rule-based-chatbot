# Rule based Chatbot
Rule Based Chatbot is a chatbot that responds to user interactions using established rules and patterns. It mimics a basic interaction between a person and an AI, giving an overview of natural language processing and rule-based systems.

##Introduction
Rule base chatbot is programmed to greet users, ask questions, and reply to their input using predetermined rules. It exhibits the fundamental functions of a chatbot, such as processing user responses, recognising patterns, and producing suitable responses.

## Features
Rule base chatbot greets users and asks their names.
